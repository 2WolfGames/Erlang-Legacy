# CI personal license

All actions use a Unity installation, wich needs to be activated. 

To make CI success, you need to do the following:

- Request an activation file for usage on GitHub
- Use that file to acquire a license
- Set the license as a secret 

About the activation file
You may use the [Unity - Request Activation](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/unity-request-activation-file) File action with the below instructions.

The activation file uses machine identifiers so you cannot perform this step locally.

Steps:
 - Create a file called .github/workflows/activation.yml and push it to repository
 - Manually run the above workflow.
 - Download the manual activation file that now appeared as an artifact and extract the Unity_v20XX.X.XXXX.alf file from the zip.
 - Visit license.unity3d.com and upload the Unity_v20XX.X.XXXX.alf file.
 - You should now receive your license file (Unity_v20XX.x.ulf) as a download. It's ok if the numbers don't match your Unity version exactly.
 - Open Github > Go to your repository > Settings > Secrets.
 - Create the following secrets;
    - UNITY_LICENSE - (Copy the contents of your license file into here)
    - UNITY_EMAIL - (Add the email address that you use to login to Unity)
    - UNITY_PASSWORD - (Add the password that you use to login to Unity)

# CI workflow

To make de CI you need to add to your deploy pipeline some build in actions
 - actions/checkout@v2
 - cache (for performance)
 - game-ci/unity-builder@v2 (builder for unity)
 - actions/upload-artifact@v2 (builder for uploading artifacts)
 - actions/download-artifact@v2 (builder for downloading artifacts)
 - JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@4.1.4 (for deploying to github pages)

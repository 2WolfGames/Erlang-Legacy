# Git instructions

## Test remote changes
- git fetch --prune (optional)
- git checkout origin/<branch>
- test, play and modify if it is needed (you must create a new branch to save changes) (switch -c <branch> or checkout -b <branch>)
- git merge to update your local branch from remote (optional)
- if you like what you see go to pull request and accept it, you are done
- if you had made changes, merge your changes to local branch and push it
